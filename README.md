## Yi Jian(One With the Sword)

### Introduction

The legit original version of the game prototype is established by C# + Unity 3D. This version is coded in Java in order to train my basic skill and knowledge in Java and components.

### Creator

The artwork is fully owned by my junior, the code is fully owned by me.

### Special thanks

The "TheZeroDoctor" Youtube Channel's content did help me alot in understanding the basics in Java and animation as I had no experience in this field. Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvJM9qNXoUYUDaDo_yfSKgn5dYnMmdN8B
