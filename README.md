## Yi Jian(One With the Sword)
A 2D pixel game with only movements of character to showcase the animations and spritesheets.
### Introduction
The legit original version of the game prototype is built using C# + Unity 3D. The Java version is made in order to train my basic skill and knowledge in Java and components.
